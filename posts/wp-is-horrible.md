# **Why I’ll Never Use WordPress Again (And Why Next.js is My New Best Friend)**

Well, there I was, swimming in the WordPress hype. People had it: "It's the best! It's perfect for a start-up! You can do everything with it!" Well, that was my cue to grab a digital surfboard and dive headfirst into the waves of web development. Well, what I didn't know was that those waves were more like the angry sea of confusion, and I would be knocked out by some rogue PHP whale.

### **The PHP Disaster**

Let's get this going with **PHP**. I was attempting to add a simple tag in my site. How hard could that be, correct? Well, after I wasn't able to do it in Visual Mode-because operating the Visual Mode was like operating a broken version of Photoshop while submerged in the water-I said, "Okay, I will simply dive into Text Mode. That'll be easier." **Big mistake.**

I opened up Text Mode, and—bam! —the whole thing was written in **PHP**. It was like I’d walked into a foreign language class where the teacher doesn’t speak a word of English, and all the textbooks are in Klingon. And to make it worse, my experience with PHP up until then had been, well, **nothing short of catastrophic**. I felt like I'd tried to hack into the Matrix and was stuck in the loading screen.

It felt like trying to read a science textbook upside down while wearing a blindfold. I tried modifying it, but it felt like attempting to make IKEA furniture with a **Rust** compiler in one hand and a frying pan in the other. I was so out of my depth, I considered just closing my laptop and calling it a day. But no, I thought, "I can do this. I can *conquer* PHP." Spoiler: I could not.

**Jokes aside**, PHP is **incredibly useful** for web development—it powers **massive websites** (WordPress, for example, is built on it!). But in the form of WordPress, PHP is like a pocketknife that’s been turned into a Swiss Army disaster. It’s functional, but when you’re trying to use it for something simple like adding a tag, it’s like using a supercomputer to microwave popcorn.

### **The Theme That Wasn’t Free**

Well, here comes the fun part. Time for a new theme. "This one looks perfect!", I thought, sleek, modern, had all the features. Problem was… **I couldn't even find where to change the theme** in the first place! WordPress Dashboard and **wp-admin** looked so alike, it was a game of "Where's Waldo?"—if Waldo had an invisibility cloak. Every time I clicked on something, I wasn't sure if I'd land in the theme settings or in some obscure menu of a plugin that I didn't need.

So I found myself clicking into menus ad nauseam, feeling as though I were on a scavenger hunt sans map. Until, finally, after all this searching, I happened upon theme options, at which point it dawned on me-**the theme I liked wasn't free. In fact, it was one of those "monthly subscription" deals. Are you kidding me? I thought WordPress was supposed to be affordable, not some subscription-based version of Netflix where you have to pay extra for the good content. I'm all about the free options, so this was a hard pass.

**Spoiler:** I didn't buy any. I was **not** about to start shelling out cash for a theme when there were so many free ones out there—without monthly payments!

### **The wp-admin Fiasco**

And then… there was **wp-admin**. By this time, I was already deep into the confusion, but wp-admin took things to a whole new level. Trying to get through all those menus gave me the feeling of being completely lost in a maze that somebody else created when he himself was lost inside the maze. It felt like the system was designed as a hoax, where **nothing** makes sense, and every click sends you further into some labyrinth of menus, settings, and random pop-ups.

It was like trying to play **Zelda** in a dungeon where every door led to another dungeon, except no one had told me which dungeon was the exit. Pure chaos.

### **The Plugin Problems**

Next, I tried adding Google Tag Manager. Simple, right? I found a plugin that should have made it easy, but guess what? It required a monthly payment. Seriously? I'm only trying to add a tag, not finance a startup! Of course, I wasn't about to start paying a subscription for something that should be free. It was like being forced to take out a membership to download a basic calculator app. In the end, I threw in the towel and gave up with plugins altogether.

### The Final Straw

And that was it—I'd had enough. I ditched WordPress faster than I would an unfinished **.bat** script with bugs that could end up crashing my computer. I didn't even bother deleting my site, it just felt like one of those things you *don't* want to acknowledge. Instead, I jumped ship and went to **Next.js**, which felt like suddenly I'd entered a world where everything was clean, functional, and most importantly-**logical**. No upselling, no plugins begging for cash at every corner, just pure and simple pleasure in the form of static site generation.

### **The Moral of the Story**

TL;DR: WordPress might be fine for some, but for me? It was like trying to play **Doom** on a potato with no RAM—frustrating and confusing.

But hey, if spending your time searching within an endless menu space, buying plugins which should be free, and trapping yourself in an interface that looks like it was designed by a lost AI from the early 2000s feels appealing to you, then WordPress would be your thing. But if you want a clean, simple, modern way to build your website without pulling out your hair over cryptic code and endless upsells, do yourself a favor and check out Next.js. It's like upgrading from a **Windows XP** to a **MacBook M1**-suddenly things just… work.

And just to be clear-I didn't pay a single cent for WordPress. Not a dime. **Not. A. Dime.**
