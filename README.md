So about the blog, the blog was made using `v0`, Vercel's new ai thingy and it is **COOL AS HECK**.

I decided to use PNPM because PNPM is love PNPM is life. (and storage saving too)

Also this blog will also not just be about programming anymore, it will be about my interests in general such as conlanging, books, (*Especially Harry Potter and Percy Jackson and the Olympians, you need to read those*) movies, fandoms, (*again harry potter and percy jackson*) games, etc. And of course we still have programming, if not why would you think `v0` added 

```typescript
console.log("syntax higlighting")
```
